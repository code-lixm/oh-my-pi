Ask user for clarification/input during task execution.

<conditions>
- Multiple approaches with significantly different tradeoffs user should weigh.
</conditions>

<instruction>
- Use `recommended: <index>` to mark default (0-indexed); " (Recommended)" added automatically
- Use `questions` for multiple related questions instead of asking one at a time
- Set `multi: true` on a question to allow multiple selections.
- Use short option labels; put explanatory tradeoffs in `description` instead of merging them into the label
</instruction>

<caution>
- Provide 2-5 concise, distinct options.
</caution>

<critical>
- Default to action. Resolve ambiguity via repo conventions, existing patterns, reasonable defaults. Exhaust existing sources (code, configs, docs, history) before asking. Ask only when options have materially different tradeoffs the user must decide.
- If multiple choices acceptable: pick most conservative/standard option; proceed; state choice.
- Do NOT include "Other"; UI automatically adds "Other (type your own)" to every question.
</critical>
